Building and running wbaes project requires M4RI, linear algebra package over GF(2). 
This package can be downloaded from http://m4ri.sagemath.org/.
After you build and install M4RI, you may still need to provide some parameters to 
"configure" in wbaes project. That depends on how the installation of M4RI was done. 
Examples of how you might run "configure" are given below:

wbaes/$ ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

This example assumes that M4RI's library and include files are installed in non-default folders.

Occasionally gcc may complain about M4RI headers requiring C99. To remedy that use CFLAGS=std=c99. For instance:

wbaes/$ ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include CFLAGS=-std=c99

To build wbaes with debugging information included use option --enable-debug:

wbaes/$ ./configure --enable-debug

After the configuration step, you may start the build:

wbaes/$ make

Again, depending on your setup you may have to provide the library path for M4RI, such as:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

And to run tests:

wbaes/$ make check
